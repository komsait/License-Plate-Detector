The dataset includes 3009 images.
Excavator are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.1 percent of pixels
